1. Applicaiton checkout from GIT repo.
2. Build the application with maven.
3. Create infrastructure on AWS as listed in main.tf file.
4. Redirect aws_instance_public_dns to aws_dns_name.txt file.
5. Redirect the password output to home directory of keybase user.
6. Shell scripting call to generate invertory.ini file for hosts, mentioned in aws_dns_name.txt
